# Guest UI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a guest-facing UI for the hotel management system with two main features:
1. Room temperature and lighting controls with presets (simulated/mock)
2. Enhanced chatbot interface with improved animations and debugging features

```

## 2. Room Controls Implementation

### Design and Features

The room controls will be a visually appealing card with:

- **Temperature Control**
  - Slider for temperature (18-30°C)
  - Visual temperature display with color gradient (blue to red)
  - Current temperature prominently displayed

- **Lighting Control**
  - Brightness slider (0-100%)
  - Color temperature control (warm to cool)
  - Visual preview of current lighting settings

- **Preset Modes**
  - Sleep Mode: Low warm light (10%), cool temperature (20°C)
  - Reading Mode: Medium warm light (60%), comfortable temperature (23°C)
  - Energy Saving: Low cool light (30%), eco temperature (25°C summer/19°C winter)
  - Each preset displayed as an attractive button with icon and label
  - Visual indication of active preset

### Implementation Details

- Create a `RoomControlContext` to manage state without backend connectivity
- Implement smooth transitions and animations between states
- Use Material-UI components with custom styling for a premium feel
- Add visual feedback for all user interactions
- Store state in localStorage to persist between sessions

## 3. Enhanced Chatbot Interface

### Design Improvements

- Modern, clean chat interface with improved spacing and layout
- Message bubbles with subtle animations when appearing
- Clear visual distinction between user and AI messages
- Smooth scrolling and transitions

### Animation Enhancements

- Typing indicator animation when the model is processing
- Message appear/disappear animations
- Subtle pulse animation for the chat input when empty
- Micro-interactions for button clicks and message sending

### Debug Features

- Debug panel that can be toggled on/off showing:
  - Message registration status (whether sent to model)
  - Response source confirmation
  - API call status and timing
  - Error messages if any
  - Current conversation state

- Status indicators:
  - "Sending..." when message is being sent
  - "Processing..." when model is thinking
  - "Received" when response comes back
  - "Error" with details when something fails

### Technical Implementation

- Enhance the existing ChatbotInterface component
- Add new animation components using CSS transitions and keyframes
- Implement debug panel with collapsible UI
- Add detailed logging and status tracking
- Ensure all states are visually represented (idle, sending, receiving, error)

## 4. Integration with Existing System

### Authentication Integration

- Add guest role to authentication system
- Create protected routes for guest users
- Implement simplified navigation for guests

### API Integration

- Connect enhanced chatbot to existing LangGraph API
- Add detailed request/response logging for debug panel
- Implement error handling with user-friendly messages

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

- **Color Scheme**: Calming, premium colors appropriate for hotel setting
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators for all asynchronous operations

## 6. Implementation Approach

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create basic component structure
   - Implement room control context
   - Set up routing for guest pages

2. **Room Controls Development**
   - Implement temperature control with visual feedback
   - Create lighting controls with preview
   - Develop preset functionality with animations

3. **Chatbot Enhancement**
   - Extend existing chatbot with improved UI
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Implement debug panel and status indicators

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - Connect components together
   - Test on different devices and browsers
   - Optimize performance

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Ensure code splitting for performance
- Add comprehensive PropTypes
- Write clean, maintainable code with comments
